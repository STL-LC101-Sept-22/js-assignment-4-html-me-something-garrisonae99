      <h2>Watch Jonathan Grow!</h2></header>
      <main>
         <div>At the very beginning of this year, while I was still pregnant with my son, I made some milestone discs. Once he was born, I was going to take pictures of him at each of the milestone dates, so that I would be able to look back and see how he's grown. These are just some of the hundreds-maybe thousands-of pictures I've taken of my son since he was born, so let's take a look at how he's grown so far.

               <p>On March 12th of 2022 at 4:19 pm, Jonathan Isaac Garrison was born! He weighed 6 lbs 5 oz, had blue-gray eyes, and lots of wavy brown hair. Unfortunately, I did not even witness this myself because right before I actually gave birth, I was whisked away for an emergency C&#8209Section. Since I didn't get an epidural during labor, they had to knock me all the way out for the C&#8209Section, which is why I was asleep when my son was delivered.</p>

               <p>There's a lot that goes on in the beginning of a baby's life. Around the time Jonathan was one month old, he was a busy guy! He met his great uncle for the first time and he even learned to frown.</p>

               <a id="section3"><h1>2 Months Old</h1></a>
               <p>At this age, I got to spend my very first Mother's Day with my baby. He also started to really like one of his favorite toys around this time: his mushroom!</p>

               <a id="section4"><h1>3 Months Old</h1></a>
               <p>One thing I loved about Jonathan's three month pictures is that they were taken right after his baby dedication. The outfit that he's wearing in these pictures is the same outfit he wore to church on the morning of his dedication (before he had a blowout, of course).</p>

               <a id="section5"><h1>4 Months Old</h1></a>
               <p>This month, Jonathan celebrated his very first Father's Day with his first art project. You'd be surprised how messy a simple handprint could end up being with a baby that can't even get away from you! He also flew on a plane for the first time ever to visit family at Disney World.</p>

               <a id="section6"><h1>5 Months Old</h1></a>
               <p>Around this time, we moved back to Illinois, so Jonathan got to spend every day with Nini, GPJ, and his aunts. And even though he wasn't fully crawling yet, he was still pretty mobile at this point! </p>

               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">This is going ot be a short break in content intended to fulfill the requirements of this assignment. I was intensely distraught upon reading the styling that was to be included because it obviously doesn't fit the color scheme that I had in mind for this page. Now that that is out of the way, we can continue with Jonathan's sixth month!</p>

               <a id="section7"><h1>6 Months Old</h1></a>
               <p>For Jonathan's six month picture, I wanted to do something a little more special than his regular milestone photo. For this month, we did a half birthday photoshoot!</p>
               <img src="./images/IMG_1909.jpg" alt="" style="width:537px;height:716px">

            <section>
               <a id="section8"><h1>7 Months Old</h1></a>
               <p>This was another month where I did a bit more than just his monthly milestone photo. One thing that Jonathan loves is being outside, so we did a mini Fall photoshoot for his seven month photos. This was right when the leaves were starting to turn, and he was absolutley mesmerized by it all! This was also the month where he got his first two teeth.</p>

            <section>
               <a id="section9"><h1>Now!</h1></a>
               <p>So, we've finally made it to the present! I am somewhat behind on his pictures as I am writing the code for this web page, so his eight month photos were actually taken the day before this assignment is due, and a few days after he said "Mama"! I have loved looking back on all of his milestone pictures as he's gotten older. It's so much more evident how fast he's grown and how much he's changed in such a short amount of time when you have a snapshot from every month to compare. By the time this course has ended, I will have his entire first year of photos to look back on. I can't wait to see what he'll look like in March!</p>
